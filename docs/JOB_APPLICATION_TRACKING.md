# Job Application Tracking Feature

## Overview

This feature enables candidates to track their job applications through our system. When candidates want to apply for a new job, they can analyze their resume against the job requirements using our ATS scoring system, then choose to either apply directly or generate a tailored resume before tracking the application.

## Architecture & Design

### SOLID Principles Implementation

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each service class has a single responsibility
  - `JobApplicationService`: Handles all job application business logic
  - `JobApplicationController`: Handles HTTP requests and responses
  - DTOs: Handle data validation and transformation

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The system is open for extension but closed for modification
  - New application statuses can be added to enums without changing existing code
  - New metadata fields can be added to the JSONB columns

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Interface implementations are substitutable
  - All interfaces can be implemented by different concrete classes without breaking functionality

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Interfaces are focused and specific
  - Separate interfaces for different operations (create, update, query)

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
  - Controller depends on service abstractions, not concrete implementations

### Clean Code Practices

- Descriptive naming conventions
- Small, focused functions
- Comprehensive error handling
- TypeScript type safety
- Proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive logging

## User Flow

### Option 1: Direct Apply and Track

1. User uploads resume and enters job details
2. System analyzes resume with ATS scoring
3. User reviews ATS score and suggestions
4. User clicks "Apply and Track" → Creates job application record with `direct_apply` source
5. System saves application with ATS analysis reference

### Option 2: Tailored Resume Flow

1. User uploads resume and enters job details
2. System analyzes resume with ATS scoring
3. User reviews ATS score and suggestions
4. User clicks "Generate Tailored Resume" → Creates optimized resume
5. User reviews tailored resume
6. User clicks "Apply with Tailored Resume" → Creates job application record with `tailored_resume` source
7. System saves application with both ATS analysis and resume generation references

## Frontend Integration

### Required Components

1. **Job Analysis Form**: Company name, position, description inputs with file upload
2. **ATS Results Display**: Score visualization, matched/missing skills, suggestions
