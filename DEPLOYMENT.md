### ✅ **Database Management**

- **Migrations**: Safe database migration handling
- **Seeding**: Automated data seeding (templates, rate limits)
- **Backup/Restore**: Database backup and restore capabilities
- **Connection**: Secure database connections via Cloud SQL Proxy

### ✅ **Development Tools**

- **API Testing**: Comprehensive endpoint testing
- **Health Checks**: Service health monitoring
- **Metrics**: Performance and deployment metrics
- **Debugging**: Advanced log filtering and analysis

## 🎯 **Complete Command Reference**

### 🚀 Deployment Commands

```bash
npm run deploy          # Deploy to production
npm run deploy:dev      # Deploy to development
npm run deploy:staging  # Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:prod     # Deploy to production (same as deploy)
```

### 📊 Environment Management

```bash
npm run logs           # View production logs
npm run logs:dev       # View development logs
npm run status         # Check service status
npm run scale          # Scale service resources
npm run rollback       # Rollback to previous version
```

### 🗄️ Database Operations

```bash
npm run db:migrate     # Run database migrations
npm run db:seed        # Seed database with initial data
npm run db:backup      # Create database backup
npm run db:connect     # Connect to database
npm run db:status      # Check database status
```

### 🛠️ Development Utilities

```bash
npm run dev:test-api   # Test API endpoints
npm run dev:health     # Check service health
npm run dev:metrics    # View service metrics
npm run dev:logs       # Advanced log filtering
npm run dev:cleanup    # Clean up local resources
npm run dev:validate   # Validate configuration
```

## 🔧 **Prerequisites**

1. **Google Cloud CLI**

   ```bash
   # Already installed ✅
   gcloud auth application-default login  # If needed
   ```

2. **Docker Desktop**

   ```bash
   # Make sure Docker is running
   docker info
   ```

3. **Project Access**
   ```bash
   # Already configured ✅
   gcloud config get-value project
   # Should show: ats-fit-backend
   ```

## 🛡️ **Cost Optimization**

### ❌ **Disabled CI/CD (Cost Savings)**

- Moved `cloudbuild.yaml` → `cloudbuild.yaml.backup`
- No automated builds (saves $$ on Cloud Build)
- Manual deployment on-demand only

### ✅ **Efficient Resource Usage**

- Environment-specific resource allocation
- Auto-scaling based on traffic
- Built-in cleanup utilities

## 🎯 **Deployment Process**

The deployment script automatically:

1. **✅ Pre-deployment Validation**
   - Checks dependencies (gcloud, docker)
   - Verifies authentication and project access
   - Validates required files and configuration

2. **✅ Environment Setup**
   - Loads all secrets from Secret Manager
   - Configures environment variables
   - Verifies database and Redis connectivity

3. **✅ Build & Push**
   - Builds optimized Docker image
   - Tags with timestamp for tracking
   - Pushes to Google Container Registry

4. **✅ Cloud Run Deployment**
   - Deploys with comprehensive configuration
   - Sets up Cloud SQL and Redis connections
   - Configures auto-scaling and security

5. **✅ Post-deployment Verification**
   - Health checks and connectivity tests
   - Performance validation
   - Deployment summary with all details

## 📈 **Your Current Environment Status**

### ✅ **Production Deployment**

- **URL**: https://ats-fit-backend-345981571037.asia-south1.run.app
- **Region**: asia-south1 (optimized for Pakistan)
- **Database**: All tables created and seeded ✅
- **Status**: Fully operational ✅

### ✅ **Resources Created**

- **Cloud Run**: Service deployed and running
- **Cloud SQL**: PostgreSQL with all tables and data
- **Redis**: Memorystore for caching
- **Secrets**: All API keys secured in Secret Manager
- **Storage**: Resume templates uploaded to AWS S3

## 🚀 **Next Deployment**
